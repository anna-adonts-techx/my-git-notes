- Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development.
- It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
- Git uses repositories to store project files and their history, enabling easy collaboration and backup.
- Common commands include `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` for managing changes.
- Branching and merging in Git make it easy to experiment with new features and integrate them into the main project.
